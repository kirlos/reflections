How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Viewing a diff helped me see the bug by making it unnecessary to check lines that had not changed from version to version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It makes it easy to go back to previous versions of code in the event functionality was lost or a bug was introduced from an earlier to later version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is more optimized for its intended use for code changes which generally involve multiple interrelated files, while google docs for example is intended for office documents which are less dependent on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log can show you all the commits that have been made to the repository, git diff can let you see the changes that have been made between the various commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It would inspire confidence in knowing that even if something were to break, it would be simple to revert back to a previous commit to get back to code that works.
