What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a git repository, git creates the requisite files for project tracking. It needs to be done in order to prepare a project for commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area does not necessarily include all the files from the working directory, and controls what ends up in the repository. It allows choice on which files in a project are committed to the repository.
